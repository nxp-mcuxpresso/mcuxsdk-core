@defgroup mmdc MMDC: Multi Mode DDR Controller Driver
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Multi Mode DDR Controller
 block of MCUXpresso SDK devices.

The MMDC is configurable high performance and optimized DDR controller that support LPDDR2 x16 memory type.
The MMDC driver provide function API to config the MMDC core and PHY register.

# Typical use case {#MMDCTpyUC}
This example shows how to use the MMDC driver to
initialize the external 16 bit DDR device.
Initialize the MMDC controller and run the initialization sequence. The external DDR device is initialized and the DDR read and write is available.

Initialize the LPDDR2 Controller and external device.
Refer to the driver examples codes located at \<SDK_ROOT\>/boards/\<BOARD\>/driver_examples/mmdc
