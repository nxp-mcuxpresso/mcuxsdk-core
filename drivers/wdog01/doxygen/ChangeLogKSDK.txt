@section wdog WDOG
  The current WDOG driver version is 2.2.0.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the wrong behavior of workMode.enableWait, workMode.enableStop,
        workMode.enableDebug in configuration structure wdog_config_t. When set
        the items to true, WDOG will continues working in those modes.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - MISRA C-2012 issue fixed: rule 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.7 and 11.9.
      - Fixed the issue of the inseparable process interrupted by other interrupt source.
        - WDOG_Init
        - WDOG_Refresh

  - 2.1.0
    - New Features
      - Added new API "WDOG_TriggerSystemSoftwareReset()" to allow users to reset the system by software.
      - Added new API "WDOG_TriggerSoftwareSignal()" to allow users to trigger a WDOG_B signal by software.
      - Removed the parameter "softwareAssertion" and "softwareResetSignal" out of the wdog_config_t structure.
      - Added new parameter "enableTimeOutAssert" to the wdog_config_t structure. With this parameter
        enabled, when the WDOG timeout occurs, a WDOG_B signal will be asserted. This signal can
        be routed to external pin of the chip. Note that WDOG_B signal remains asserted until
        a power-on reset (POR) occurs.

  - 2.0.1
    - New Features
      - Added control macro to enable/disable the CLOCK code in current driver.
