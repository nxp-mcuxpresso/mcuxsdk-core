@defgroup rdc RDC: Resource Domain Controller
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a driver for the RDC module of MCUXpresso SDK devices.

The Resource Domain Controller (RDC) provides robust support for the isolation of
destination memory mapped locations such as peripherals and memory to a single core, a
bus master, or set of cores and bus masters.\n

The RDC driver should be used together with the RDC_SEMA42 driver.
