      This parameter defines the maximum number of iterations for any polling loop
      in the SEMA42 driver code before timing out and returning an error.

      It applies to all waiting loops in SEMA42 driver, such as waiting for a gate
      to be unlocked, waiting for a reset to complete, or waiting for a resource
      to become available.

      This is a count of loop iterations, not a time-based value.

      If set to 0, polling loops will continue indefinitely until their exit condition
      is met, which could potentially cause the system to hang if hardware doesn't respond
      or if a resource is never released.
