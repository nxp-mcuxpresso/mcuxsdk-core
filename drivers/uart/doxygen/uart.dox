@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
         module of MCUXpresso SDK devices.

The UART driver includes functional APIs and transactional APIs.

Functional APIs are used for UART initialization/configuration/operation for
optimization/customization purpose. Using the functional API requires the
knowledge of the UART peripheral and how to organize functional APIs to
meet the application requirements. All functional APIs use the peripheral base
address as the first parameter. UART functional operation groups provide the
functional API set.

Transactional APIs can be used to enable the peripheral quickly and in the
application if the code size and performance of transactional APIs can satisfy the
requirements. If the code size and performance are critical requirements,
see the transactional API implementation and write custom code. All
transactional APIs use the uart_handle_t as the second parameter.
Initialize the handle by calling the UART_TransferCreateHandle() API.

Transactional APIs support asynchronous transfer, which means that the functions
UART_TransferSendNonBlocking() and UART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking() set up an interrupt for data
transfer. When the transfer completes, the upper layer is notified through a callback
function with the kStatus_UART_TxIdle and kStatus_UART_RxIdle.

Transactional receive APIs support the ring buffer. Prepare the
memory for the ring buffer and pass in the start address and size while calling the
UART_TransferCreateHandle(). If passing  NULL, the ring buffer feature is disabled.
When the ring buffer is enabled, the received data is saved to the ring buffer in the background.
The UART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking() function first gets data from the ring buffer. If
the ring buffer does not have enough data, the function first returns the data in the
ring buffer and then saves the received data to user memory. When all data is received,
the upper layer is informed through a callback with the kStatus_UART_RxIdle.

If the receive ring buffer is full, the upper layer is informed through a callback with the
kStatus_UART_RxRingBufferOverrun. In the callback function, the upper layer reads
data out from the ring buffer. If not, existing data is overwritten by the new data.

The ring buffer size is specified when creating the handle. Note that
one byte is reserved for the ring buffer maintenance. When
creating handle using the following code.

Refer to the driver examples codes located at \<SDK_ROOT\>/boards/\<BOARD\>/driver_examples/uart
In this example, the buffer size is 32, but only 31 bytes are used for
saving data.
