  The current MIPI_DSI driver version is 2.2.2.

  - 2.2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed CERT-C violations.

  - 2.2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed issue that VACTIVE setting shall equal to the number of active lines (height), no need to minus 1.
    - Improvements
      - Update DSI_Deinit to reset peripheral.
      - Update DSI_DeinitDphy to power down DPHY using DPHY_PD_REG before powering down PLL.

  - 2.2.0
    - New Features
      - Added APIs to configure DBI FIFO and payload.
      - Supported new controls and configurations of DBI pixel format, PHY ready and ULPS for RT700.
      - Updated the DPI setting to use float for coefficient value for more accurate calculation.

  - 2.1.6
    - Improvements
      - Release peripheral from reset if necessary in init function.

  - 2.1.5
    - Other Changes
      - Changed to use new register naming.
      - Added workaround for Errata ERR011439. Avoid DCS long packet command writes with zero-length
        data payload in low-power mode, because the checksum is incorrect in this case.

  - 2.1.4
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA issues.

    - Improvements
      - Supported long package read.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that runs to hardfault when sending long packet with 4-byte unaligned address.

  - 2.1.1
    - Improvements
      - Some SOC compatibility improvement.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Improved for the platforms which does not support ULPS.

  - 2.0.6
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the timing issue that non-continuous HS clock mode does not work.

  - 2.0.5
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed kDSI_InterruptGroup1BtaTo and kDSI_InterruptGroup1HtxTo
        definition error.
    - Improvements
      - Changed to override MIPI_DriverIRQHandler instead of MIPI_IRQHandler.

  - 2.0.4
