@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Glitch Detect (GDET) module.@n
 @n
GDET is an on-chip sensor that enables protection of the chip from glitch attacks. The Boot ROM configures and enables the
GDET during device initialization.
Glitch detection is based on the expected core voltage (CORE_VDD), so the GDET module must be reconfigured if the core
voltage is changed
