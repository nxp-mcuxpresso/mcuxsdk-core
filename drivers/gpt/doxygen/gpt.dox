@defgroup gpt GPT: General Purpose Timer
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a driver for the General Purpose Timer (GPT)
         of MCUXpresso SDK devices.

# Function groups {#GPTFunc}
The gpt driver supports the generation of PWM signals, input capture, and
setting up the timer match conditions.

## Initialization and deinitialization {#GPTInit}
The function GPT_Init() initializes the gpt with specified configurations. The function
GPT_GetDefaultConfig() gets the default configurations. The initialization function
configures the restart/free-run mode and input selection when running.

The function GPT_Deinit() stops the timer and turns off the module clock.

# Typical use case {#GptCase}

## GPT interrupt example {#GPTInterruptExample}
Set up a channel to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second.
