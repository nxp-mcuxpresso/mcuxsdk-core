@section usart USART
  The current USART driver version is 2.3.1.

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Use separate data for TX and RX in usart_transfer_t.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug that when ring buffer is used, if some data is received in ring buffer first before calling
        USART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking, the received data count returned by USART_TransferGetReceiveCount is wrong.

  - 2.3.0
    - New Features
      - Modified usart_config_t, USART_Init and USART_GetDefaultConfig APIs so that the hardware flow control can be
        enabled during module initialization.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed compiling error in USART_TransferSendDMA and USART_TransferReceiveDMA.
    - Improvements
      - Modified USART_TransferHandleIRQ so that txState will be set to idle only when all data has been sent out to bus.
      - Modified USART_TransferGetSendCount so that this API returns the real byte count that USART has sent out rather
        than the software buffer status.
      - Added timeout mechanism when waiting for certain states in transfer driver.
      - Added check for baud rate's accuracy that returns kStatus_USART_BaudrateNotSupport when the best achieved baud
        rate is not within 3% error of configured baud rate.

  - 2.1.1
    - Improvements
      - Deleted useless if condition.
      - Added check for kUSART_TxIdleFlag in USART_TransferHandleIRQ to ensure all the data would be sent out
        to bus before triggering call back.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the sign-compare warning in USART_TransferHandleIRQ.
      - Eliminated IAR Pa082 warning from USART_TransferGetRxRingBufferLength and USART_TransferHandleIRQ.
      - Modified USART_ReadBlocking so that if more than one receiver errors occur, all status flags will be
        cleared and the most severe error status will be returned.
      - Fixed MISRA issues.
        - Fixed issue 2.2, 8.4, 5.7, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.8, 11.6, 11.9, 14.4, 16.4, 17.7.

  - 2.1.0
    - New Features
      - Added new feature to allow users to configure the USART to synchronous transfer in both master and slave mode.

  - 2.0.1
    - New Features
      - Added control macro to enable/disable the RESET and CLOCK feature in current driver.
      - Added a new API to allow users to enable the CTS which determines whether CTS is used for flow control.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
