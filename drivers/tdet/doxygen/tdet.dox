@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Digital Tamper (TDET) module.@n
 @n
TDET detects potential on-chip and external device tampering, triggering an interrupt or chip reset. In addition to passive tamper
detection where a static value is expected, TDET also provides active tamper detection on a board by streaming a known bit
sequence and checking that their return values match what was sent.
