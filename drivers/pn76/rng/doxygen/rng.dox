@defgroup rng RNG: Random Number Generator
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Random Number Generator module of MCUXpresso SDK devices.

The Random Number Generator is a hardware module that generates 32-bit random numbers.
A typical consumer is a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) which can be implemented to achieve both true randomness and cryptographic strength random numbers using the RNG output as its entropy seed.
The data generated by a RNG is intended for direct use by functions that generate secret keys, per-message secrets, random challenges, and other similar quantities used in cryptographic algorithms.
