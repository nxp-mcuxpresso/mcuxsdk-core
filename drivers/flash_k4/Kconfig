        flash_k4 driver is also compatible with FMU IP used on MCX A/N devices
        however its integration into SDK is currently problematic due to API
        collision with ROM based FLASH driver. This option is used to enable the
        use of flash_k4 driver and prevent its automatic enablement based on IP
        compatibility.
