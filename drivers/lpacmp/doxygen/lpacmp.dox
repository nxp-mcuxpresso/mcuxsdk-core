@defgroup lpacmp LPACMP: Low-Power Analog Comparator Driver
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Low-Power Analog Comparator (LPACMP) 
         module of MCUXpresso SDK devices. This driver is designed to facilitate the setup and management
         of the LPACMP module, offering various functionalities for configuring channels, setting
         operation modes, and handling interrupts.

Based on features of the LPACMP module, this driver is divided into the following function groups:

# LPACMP Initialization, De-Initialization, and Configuration
    Functions in this group are used for:
    - Initializing the LPACMP module.
    - De-initializing the LPACMP module.
    - Enabling/disabling the comparator module.
    - Configuring comparator modes and intervals.

# LPACMP Channel Configuration
    Functions in this group are used for:
    - Configuring individual comparator channels.
    - Enabling/disabling the wakeup to SMM and trigger output for each channel.
    - Setting delay values, comparison polarities, and trigger output widths.

# LPACMP Interrupt Control
    Functions in this group are used for:
    - Enabling/disabling match interrupts for specific channels.
    - Clearing comparison interrupt status flags.
    - Retrieving the current interrupt status.
