@page driver_log Driver Change Log

@section uart UART
  The current UART driver version is 2.3.2.

  - 2.3.2
    - Improvements
      - Make driver aarch64 compatible

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Use separate data for TX and RX in uart_transfer_t.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug that when ring buffer is used, if some data is received in ring buffer first before calling
        UART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking, the received data count returned by UART_TransferGetReceiveCount is wrong.

  - 2.3.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed DMA transfer blocking issue by enabling tx idle interrupt after DMA transmission finishes.

  - 2.2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed MISRA 2012 rule 10.4 violation.

  - 2.2.0
    - New Features
      - Modified uart_config_t, UART_Init and UART_GetDefaultConfig APIs so that the RTS and CTS used for hardware flow
        control can be enabled during module initialization.
      - Added API UART_SetRxRTSWatermark so that the water mark level of RTS deassertion can be configured.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed MISRA 8.5 violation.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Added timeout mechanism when waiting for certain states in transfer driver.

  - 2.0.2
    - Improvements
      - Added check for transmission complete in UART_WriteBlocking, UART_TransferHandleIRQ and UART_SendSDMACallback
        to ensure all the data would be sent out to bus.
      - Modified UART_ReadBlocking so that if more than one receiver errors occur, all status flags will be cleared
        and the most severe error status will be returned.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed MISRA issues.
        - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 11.9, 14.4.

  - 2.0.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Memset local variable SDMA transfer configuration structure to make sure unused members in structure are cleared.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
