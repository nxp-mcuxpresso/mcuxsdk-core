  - 2.6.0
    - New Features
      - Added new feature macro to distinguish whether the GPADC_CTRL0_GPADC_TSAMP control bit is on the device.
      - Added new variable extendSampleTimeNumber to indicate the ADC extend sample time.
    - Bugfix
      - Fixed the bug that incorrectly sets the PASS_ENABLE bit based on the sample time setting.

      - Enabled self-calibration after clock divider be changed to make sure the frequency update be taken.

  - 2.4.0
    - New Features
      - Added new API ADC_DoOffsetCalibration() which supports a specific operation frequency.
    - Other Changes
      - Marked the ADC_DoSelfCalibration(ADC_Type *base) as deprecated.
