  - 2.6.0
    - New Features
      - Added new feature FSL_FEATURE_SPC_HAS_SC_SPC_LP_REQ_BIT for compatibility with
        new platforms that do not support the SPC SC[SPC_LP_MODE] bitfield.

  - 2.5.0
    - New Features
      - Added new function group to support high power feature.

  - 2.4.1
    - Improvements
      - Added the new feature FSL_FEATURE_SPC_HAS_SC_REG_BUSY to support the device which has the SC[REG_BUSY] bitfield.

  - 2.4.0
    - Improvements
      - Set functions of VD_SYS_CFG[LVSEL] configuration as deprecated, 
        since this bit filed is reserved for all devices.

  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Added SPC_SetSRAMOperateVoltage() to set SRAM operate voltage.

    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the issue in SPC_SetDCDCBurstConfig() function.
      - Fixed a bug that is SPC has VDD_DS the voltage is not configured correctly.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - The default value of ACTIVE_CFG[CORELDO_VDD_DS] bit is 1, removed code of set that bit.
      - Fixed an issue of SPC_SetDCDCBurstConfig() to avoid program stuck in a while loop.
      - Removed some duplicate code that never reached.

    - Improvements
      - Added two APIs to control Vdd core glitch detect feature in Active/lowpower modes.
