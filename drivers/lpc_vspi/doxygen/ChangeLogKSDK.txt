@section spi SPI
  The current SPI driver version is 2.0.6.

  - 2.0.6
    - Improvements
      - Changed SPI_DUMMYDATA to 0x00.
      
  - 2.0.5
    - Improvements
      - Added FIFO and Tx status checking to ensure callback is invoked after Tx data is totally sent out in half-duplex transfer.

  - 2.0.4
    - Improvements
      - Added timeout mechanism when waiting certain states in transfer driver.

  - 2.0.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Eliminated IAR Pa082 warning from SPI_SendTransfer, SPI_MasterTransferBlocking, SPI_SetupDummy,
        SPI_MasterTransferHandleIRQ and SPI_SlaveTransferHandleIRQ.
      - Fixed MISRA issues,
        - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.7, 11.6, 11.9, 14.4, 16.4, 17.7.

  - 2.0.2
    - New Features
      - Added control macro to enable/disable the RESET and CLOCK code in current driver.
      - Added wait mechanism in SPI_MasterTransferBlocking API, checking if master SPI becomes IDLE when
        the EOT bit is set before returning. This confirms all data will be sent out by SPI master.

  - 2.0.1
    - Improvements
      - Optimized the code to improve the performance of both blocking and nonblocking transfer.
      - Changed the default value of TX FIFO size and RX FIFO size in SPI_MasterGetDefaultConfig and
        SPI_SlaveGetDefaultConfig to 0. Because different devices may have different FIFO sizes, a fixed value
        may not be very adaptable. So, users need to configure the TX and RX FIFO size in their applications
        as they want if FIFO is enabled.
    - New Features
      - Added new feature to support the ignore receive function, this update makes the transfer faster
        if no need to receive data, both blocking and nonblocking transfer can support this feature.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
