      This parameter defines the maximum number of iterations for any polling loop
      in the MU code before timing out and returning an error.

      It applies to all waiting loops in MU driver, such as waiting for TX register
      to be empty or waiting for RX register to be full.

      This is a count of loop iterations, not a time-based value.

      If set to 0, polling loops will continue indefinitely until their exit condition
      is met, which could potentially cause the system to hang if a core becomes
      unresponsive.
