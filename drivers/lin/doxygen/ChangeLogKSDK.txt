@section lin LIN
  Current LIN driver version is 2.2.3

  - 2.2.3
    - Improvements
      - Conditionally compile interrupt handling code to solve the problem of using this driver on CPU cores that do not support interrupts.

  - 2.2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug in LIN_LPUART_Init, while disabling the LPUART ERROR IRQ, the variable g_linLpuartErrIrqId should
        be used instead of g_linLpuartRxTxIrqId. This is a typo issue.

  - 2.2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug in LIN_LPUART_GetTransmitStatus and LIN_LPUART_GetReceiveStatus, if the current event ID is
        timeout, then the timeout service has already been executed, LIN_TIMEOUT should be returned.
      - Fixed bug in LIN_LPUART_AutobaudTimerValEval, if the calculated MasterBaudrate is 0 which means the baudrate
        is not supported, then there is no need to update the baudrate configuration, just set the node to idle state.
      - Fixed issue in LIN_LPUART_CheckWakeupSignal, the check on the timerGetTimeIntervalCallback should be executed
        after the first falling edge rather than the second.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug that for lin slave once break field is detected before completing the last frame no error status is
        raised.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA C-2012 issue.
        - Fixed rules, containing: rule-10.8, 10.3.
      - Fixed bug in LIN_MakeChecksumByte, when frame ID is 0x3D the PID should be 0x7D.

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Updated the driver to support LIN stack.
        - For LIN_LPUART_Init() function, if run successfully, the return is LIN_SUCCESS instead of LIN_INITIALIZED.
        - Changed the LIN event ID name from "LIN_RECV_SYNC_OK" to "LIN_SYNC_OK".
        - Changed the LIN event ID name from "LIN_RECV_SYNV_ERROR" to "LIN_SYNV_ERROR".
        - Changed the definition macro name "LIN_MAKE_PARITY" to "MAKE_PARITY".
        - Changed the definition macro name "LIN_CHECK_PARITY" to "CHECK_PARITY".
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA C-2012 issue.
        - Fixed rules, containing: rule-17.7, rule-14.4, rule-11.9, rule-10.4, rule-10.3, rule-10.7, rule-10.1, rule-8.6,
