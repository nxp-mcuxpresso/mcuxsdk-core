# NETC

## [2.10.2]

- Bug Fixes

  - Supported IP version class commands in VSI-PSI message driver.
  - Added VSI3 definition.

## [2.10.0]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed structures used for time gate control list and stream gate request commands memset.
- New Features
  - Added public API to query table entry in Frame Modification Table.
- Improvements
  - Removed calls to memset/memcpy in the transmit path.

## [2.9.1]

- Improvements
  - NETC_TimerInit() will always ignore user config->atomicMode and set it to 1 internally. This guarantees that period updates, that change both the integer and fractional part are always done atomically.

  - Fixed MII mode setting.
  - Fixed i.MX943 getting function instance.
- New Features
  - Added API to Reset IRX and OEX flags in stream gate instance entry.
  - Added API to configure the priority to traffic class map.
  - Added APIs to query table entry and get maximum entry number for Frame Modification Table.

- Improvements
  - keep netc_tb_sgi_rsp_data_t local to the low level driver functions for SGI table entry query.
  - Converted to use preinitVsi callback for VSI pre-init.
  - Added note for ERRATA 052167 to remind that actual MAC Tx IPG is longer than configured when
    transmitting back-to-back packets in MII half duplex. When using MII protocol, using full-duplex
    mode is recommended instead of half-duplex. If using MII half-duplex mode, additional bandwidth
    loss should be expected and accounted for due to extended IPG.
