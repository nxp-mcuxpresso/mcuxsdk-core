# FLEXIO_I2C

## [2.6.0]

- Improvements
  - Supported platforms which don't have DOZE mode control.

## [2.5.1]

- Improvements
  - Conditionally compile interrupt handling code to solve the problem of using this driver on CPU cores that do not support interrupts.

## [2.5.0]

- Improvements
  - Split some functions, fixed CCM problem in file fsl_flexio_i2c_master.c.

## [2.4.0]

- Improvements
  - Added delay of 1 clock cycle in FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferRunStateMachine to ensure that bus would be idle
    before next transfer if master is nacked.
  - Fixed issue that the restart setup time is less than the time in I2C spec by adding delay of 1 clock cycle
    before restart signal.

## [2.3.0]

- Improvements
  - Used 3 timers instead of 2 to support transfer which is more than 14 bytes in single transfer.
  - Improved FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferGetCount so that the API can check whether the transfer is still in progress.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed MISRA 10.4 issues.

## [2.2.0]

- New Features
  - Added timeout mechanism when waiting certain state in transfer API.
  - Added an API for checking bus pin status.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed COVERITY issue of useless call in FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferRunStateMachine.
  - Fixed MISRA issues
    - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.7, 11.6, 11.9, 14.4, 17.7.
  - Added codes in FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferCreateHandle to clear pending NVIC IRQ, disable
    internal IRQs before enabling NVIC IRQ.
  - Modified code so that during master's nonblocking transfer the start and slave address are sent
    after interrupts being enabled, in order to avoid potential issue of sending the start and slave address
    twice.

## [2.1.7]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the issue that FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferBlocking did not wait for STOP bit sent.
  - Fixed COVERITY issue of useless call in FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferRunStateMachine.
  - Fixed the issue that I2C master did not check whether bus was busy before transfer.

## [2.1.6]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the issue that I2C Master transfer APIs(blocking/non-blocking) did not support the situation of master
    transfer with subaddress and transfer data size being zero, which means no data followed the subaddress.

## [2.1.5]

- Improvements
  - Unified component full name to FLEXIO I2C Driver.

## [2.1.4]

- Bug Fixes
  - The following modifications support FlexIO using multiple instances:
    - Removed FLEXIO_Reset API in module Init APIs.
    - Updated module Deinit APIs to reset the shifter/timer config instead of disabling module/clock.
    - Updated module Enable APIs to only support enable operation.

## [2.1.3]

- Improvements
  - Changed the prototype of FLEXIO_I2C_MasterInit to return kStatus_Success if initialized successfully or to
    return kStatus_InvalidArgument if "(srcClock_Hz / masterConfig->baudRate_Bps) / 2 - 1" exceeds 0xFFU.

## [2.1.2]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the FLEXIO I2C issue where the master could not receive data from I2C slave in high baudrate.
  - Fixed the FLEXIO I2C issue where the master could not receive NAK when master sent non-existent addr.
  - Fixed the FLEXIO I2C issue where the master could not get transfer count successfully.
  - Fixed the FLEXIO I2C issue where the master could not receive data successfully when sending data first.
  - Fixed the Dozen mode configuration error in FLEXIO_I2C_MasterInit API. For enableInDoze = true, the
    configuration should be 0; for enableInDoze = false, the configuration should be 1.
  - Fixed the issue that FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferBlocking API called FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferCreateHandle, which
    lead to the s_flexioHandle/s_flexioIsr/s_flexioType variable being written. Then, if calling
    FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferBlocking API multiple times, the s_flexioHandle/s_flexioIsr/s_flexioType variable
    would not be written any more due to it being out of range. This lead to the following situation:
    NonBlocking transfer APIs could not work due to the fail of register IRQ.

## [2.1.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Implemented the FLEXIO_I2C_MasterTransferBlocking API which is defined in header file but has no
    implementation in the C file.

## [2.1.0]

- New Features
  - Added Transfer prefix in transactional APIs.
  - Added transferSize in handle structure to record the transfer size.
