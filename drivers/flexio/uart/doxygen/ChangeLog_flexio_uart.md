# FLEXIO_UART

## [2.6.2]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed coverity issues

## [2.6.1]

- Improvements
  - Improve baudrate calculation method, to support higher frequency FlexIO clock source.

## [2.6.0]

- Improvements
  - Supported platforms which don't have DOZE mode control.

## [2.5.1]

- Improvements
  - Conditionally compile interrupt handling code to solve the problem of using this driver on CPU cores that do not support interrupts.

## [2.5.0]

- Improvements
  - Added API FLEXIO_UART_FlushShifters to flush UART fifo.

## [2.4.0]

- Improvements
  - Use separate data for TX and RX in flexio_uart_transfer_t.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed bug that when ring buffer is used, if some data is received in ring buffer first before calling
    FLEXIO_UART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking, the received data count returned by FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetReceiveCount
    is wrong.

## [2.3.0]

- Improvements
  - Added check for baud rate's accuracy that returns kStatus_FLEXIO_UART_BaudrateNotSupport when the best
    achieved baud rate is not within 3% error of configured baud rate.
- Bug Fixes
  - Added codes in FLEXIO_UART_TransferCreateHandle to clear pending NVIC IRQ before enabling NVIC IRQ, to fix issue
    of pending IRQ interfering the on-going process.

## [2.2.0]

- Improvements
  - Added timeout mechanism when waiting for certain states in transfer driver.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed MISRA 10.4 issues.

## [2.1.6]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed IAR Pa082 warnings.
  - Fixed MISRA issues
    - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.7, 11.6, 11.9, 14.4, 17.7.

## [2.1.5]

- Improvements
  - Triggered user callback after all the data in ringbuffer were received in FLEXIO_UART_TransferReceiveNonBlocking.

## [2.1.4]

- Improvements
  - Unified component full name to FLEXIO UART(DMA/EDMA) Driver.

## [2.1.3]

- Bug Fixes
  - The following modifications support FLEXIO using multiple instances:
    - Removed FLEXIO_Reset API in module Init APIs.
    - Updated module Deinit APIs to reset the shifter/timer configuration instead of disabling module and clock.
    - Updated module Enable APIs to only support enable operation.

## [2.1.2]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the transfer count calculation issue in FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetReceiveCount,
    FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetSendCount, FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetReceiveCountDMA, FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetSendCountDMA,
    FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetReceiveCountEDMA and FLEXIO_UART_TransferGetSendCountEDMA.
  - Fixed the Dozen mode configuration error in FLEXIO_UART_Init API. For enableInDoze = true, the configuration
    should be 0; for enableInDoze = false, the configuration should be 1.
  - Added code to report errors if the user sets a too-low-baudrate which FLEXIO cannot reach.
  - Disabled FLEXIO_UART receive interrupt instead of all NVICs when reading data from ring buffer.
    If ring buffer is used, receive nonblocking will disable all NVIC interrupts to protect
    the ring buffer. This had negative effects on other IPs using interrupt.

## [2.1.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Changed the API name FLEXIO_UART_StopRingBuffer to FLEXIO_UART_TransferStopRingBuffer to align
    with the definition in C file.

## [2.1.0]

- New Features
  - Added Transfer prefix in transactional APIs.
  - Added txSize/rxSize in handle structure to record the transfer size.
- Bug Fixes
  - Added an error handle to handle the situation that data count is zero or data buffer is NULL.
