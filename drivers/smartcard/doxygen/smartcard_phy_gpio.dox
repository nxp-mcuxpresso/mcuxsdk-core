@ingroup smartcard_phy_driver
@details The Smart Card interface GPIO driver handles the GPIO and FTM/TPM peripheral for clock generation, which covers all necessary functions to control
the ICC. These functions are
ICC clock setup, ICC voltage turning on/off, activation/deactivation, and ICC reset sequences. This driver doesn't support the ICC pin short circuit protection and
an emergency deactivation.
