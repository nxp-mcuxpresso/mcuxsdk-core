@defgroup pmu PMU: Power Management Unit
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Power Management Unit (PMU) module of
MCUXpresso SDK devices. The power management unit (PMU) is designed to simplify the external power
interface. The power system can be split into the input power sources and their characteristics,
the integrated power transforming and controlling elements, and the final load interconnection
and requirements. By using the internal LDO regulators, the number of external supplies is greatly
reduced. 

The PMU driver provides the APIs to adjust the work condition of each regulator, and can gate the
power of some modules.
