@section adc_etc ADC_ETC
  The current ADC_ETC driver version is 2.3.1.

  - 2.3.1
    - Improvements
      - Change ADC_ETC default DMA Mode to kADC_ETC_TrigDMAWithPulsedSignal.
        Generally speaking, DMA transfer requests should only be cleared by DMA ACK,
        and the CPU should not clear the request source.
        If some users use option kADC_ETC_TrigDMAWithLatchedSignal, changing the mode to
        kADC_ETC_TrigDMAWithPulsedSignal also meet their requirements.

  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Added blocking way to implement SW trigger.

  - 2.2.1
    - Improvements
      - Moditied macro  "ADC_ETC_DONE2_ERR_IRQ_TRIG0_DONE2_MASK" to "ADC_ETC_DONE2_3_ERR_IRQ_TRIG0_DONE2_MASK" based
        on the updates of header file.

  - 2.2.0
    - Improvements
      - Defined two macros to support some devices that do not equipped with
        TSC trigger.
