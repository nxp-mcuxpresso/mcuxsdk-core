@section spifi SPI Flash Interface
  The current SPIFI driver version is 2.0.3.

  - 2.0.3
  - Bug Fixes
      - MISRA C-2012 issue fixed: rule 10.3, 10.4, and 14.4.

  - 2.0.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the command function set issue. After the command being set, there will be no wait for the CMD flag, as
        it may have been cleared by CS deassert.

  - 2.0.1
    - New Features
      - Added an API to read/write 1/2 Bytes data from/to SPIFI. This interface is useful for flash command, which only
        needs 1/2 Bytes data. The previous driver needed users to make sure of the minimum length being 4, which might
        cause issues in some flash commands.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
