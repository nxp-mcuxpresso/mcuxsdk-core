  - Fixed the issue that PWM_UpdatePwmDutycycle() can't update duty cycle status value correct.

## [2.5.0]

- Improvements
  - Added API PWM_SetOouputToIdle to set pwm channel output to idle.
  - Added API PWM_GetPwmChannelState to get the pwm channel output duty cycle value.
  - Added API PWM_SetPwmForceOutputToZero to set the pwm channel output to zero logic.
  - Added API PWM_SetChannelOutput to set the pwm channel output state.
  - Added API PWM_SetClockMode to set the value of the clock prescaler.
  - Added API PWM_SetupPwmPhaseShift to set PWM which a special phase shift and 50% duty cycle.
