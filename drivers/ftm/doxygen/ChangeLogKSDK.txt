        - FTM_GetSoftwareOutputValue()
        - FTM_GetSoftwareOutputEnable()
      - Support new API to update FTM counter initial value, modulo value and chanle value:
        - FTM_SetInitialModuloValue()
        - FTM_SetChannelValue()

  - 2.6.1
    - Improvements
      - Release peripheral from reset if necessary in init function.

  - 2.6.0
    - Improvements
      - Added support to half and full cycle reload feature with new APIs:
        - FTM_SetLdok()
        - FTM_SetHalfCycPeriod()
        - FTM_LoadFreq()
    - Bug Fixes
      - Set the HWRSTCNT and SWRSTCNT bits to optional at initialization.

  - 2.5.0
    - Improvements
      - Added FTM_CalculateCounterClkDiv to help calculates the counter clock prescaler.
      - Modify FTM_UpdatePwmDutycycle API to make it return pwm duty cycles status.
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed TPM_SetupPwm can't configure 100% center align combined PWM issues.

  - 2.4.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Added function macro to determine if FTM instance has only basic features, to prevent access
        to protected register bits.

  - 2.4.0
    - Improvements
      - Added CNTIN register initialization in FTM_SetTimerPeriod API.
      - Added a new API to read the captured value of a FTM channel configured in capture mode:
        - FTM_GetInputCaptureValue()

  - 2.3.0
    - Improvements
      - Added support of EdgeAligned/CenterAligned/Asymmetrical combine PWM mode in FTM_SetupPWM()
        and FTM_SetupPwmMode() APIs.
      - Remove kFTM_ComplementaryPwm from support PWM mode, and add new parameter "enableComplementary"
        in structure ftm_chnl_pwm_signal_param_t.
      - Rename FTM_SetupFault() API to FTM_SetupFaultInput() to avoid ambiguity.

  - 2.2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - MISRA C-2012 issue fixed: rule 14.4 and 17.7.

  - 2.2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the issue that when FTM instance has only TPM features cannot be initialized
        by FTM_Init() function. By added function macro to assert FTM is TPM only instance.

  - 2.2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - MISRA C-2012 issue fixed: rule 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.7 and 11.9.

  - 2.2.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the issue of comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions.
    - Improvements
      - Added support of complementary mode in FTM_SetupPWM() and FTM_SetupPwmMode() APIs.
      - Added new parameter "enableDeadtime" in structure ftm_chnl_pwm_signal_param_t.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed COVERITY integer handing issue where the right operand of a left bit shift statement
        should not be a negative value. This appears in FTM_SetReloadPoints().

  - 2.1.0
    - Improvements
      - Added a new API FTM_SetupPwmMode() to allow the user to set the channel match value in units
        of timer ticks. New configure structure called ftm_chnl_pwm_config_param_t was added
        to configure the channel's PWM parameters. This API is similar with FTM_SetupPwm() API,
        but the new API will not set the timer period(MOD value), it will be useful for users to
        set the PWM parameters without changing the timer period.

    - Bug Fixes
      - Added feature macro to enable/disable the external trigger source configuration.

  - 2.0.4
    - Improvements
      - Added a new API to enable DMA transfer:
        - FTM_EnableDmaTransfer()

  - 2.0.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Updated the FTM driver to enable fault input after configuring polarity.

  - 2.0.2
    - Improvements
      - Added support to Quad Decoder feature with new APIs:
        - FTM_GetQuadDecoderFlags()
        - FTM_SetQuadDecoderModuloValue()
        - FTM_GetQuadDecoderCounterValue()
        - FTM_ClearQuadDecoderCounterValue()

  - 2.0.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Updated the FTM driver to fix write to ELSA and ELSB bits.
      - FTM combine mode: set the COMBINE bit before writing to CnV register.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
