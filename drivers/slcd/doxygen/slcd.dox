@defgroup slcd SLCD: Segment LCD Driver
@details The MCUXpresso SDK provides a peripheral driver for the Segment LCD (SLCD)
module of MCUXpresso SDK devices. The SLCD module is a CMOS charge pump voltage inverter
that is designed for low voltage and low-power operation.
SLCD is designed to generate the appropriate waveforms to drive multiplexed numeric, alphanumeric, or custom segment LCD panels.
SLCD also has several timing and control settings that can be software-configured
depending on the application's requirements. Timing and control consists of registers and
control logic for the following:

1. LCD frame frequency
2. Duty cycle selection
3. Front plane/back plane selection and enabling
4. Blink modes and frequency
5. Operation in low-power modes

# Plane Setting and Display Control {#SLCDPlaneSetDC}

After the SLCD general initialization, the SLCD_SetBackPlanePhase(),
SLCD_SetFrontPlaneSegments(), and SLCD_SetFrontPlaneOnePhase()
are used to set the special back/front Plane
to make SLCD display correctly. Then, the independent display control APIs,
SLCD_StartDisplay() and SLCD_StopDisplay(), start and stop the SLCD display.

The SLCD_StartBlinkMode() and SLCD_StopBlinkMode() are provided for
the runtime special blink mode control.
To get the SLCD fault detection result,  call the SLCD_GetFaultDetectCounter().


# Typical use case {#SLCDTpyUC}

## SLCD Initialization operation {#SLCDInitOpera}
