      - Correct legacy SEMC SRAM function feature macros.
    - Improvements
      - Add new SEMC SRAM function feature macros.

  - 2.5.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed violations of the MISRA C-2012 Rule 14.3.
      - Fixed SEMC_ConfigureDBI bug that RDX not set correctly.

  - 2.5.0
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed definitions of bitfields of BMCR0 and BMCR1 - wrong field order and incorrect semantical naming
      - The fix alters the driver API regarding configuration of AXI bus queue reordering

    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed violations of the MISRA C-2012 Rule 5.6.

  - 2.4.2
    - Improvements
      - Deleted meaningless parameter in memory size conversion function.

  - 2.4.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed PSRAM A8 configuration issue, which should be 0x06U for PSRAM while pix mux bit width is 0x04U, based on different pix mux bit width.

  - 2.4.0
    - Improvements
      - Improved nor and sram timing configuration on sync mode.

  - 2.3.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Updated refresh timer period(RT) timing setting, which updated into (RT+1)*(Prescaler period) for SDRAM.
      - Supported new DBI control register 2 to configure CSX interval time(CEITV).
      - Fixed violations of the MISRA C-2012 Rule 10.8.
      - Fixed doxygen warning.

    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the SEMC queueA and queueB weight configuration issue.
      - Fixed the wrong configuration of DBICR1 register in SEMC_ConfigureDBI.

  - 2.0.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Added feature macro to control WDS&WDH bit setting for NOR synchronous transfer.

  - 2.0.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Changed SEMC NAND configuration structure and verify SEMC NAND related APIs.
      - Added extended SEMC clock enable.

  - 2.0.1
